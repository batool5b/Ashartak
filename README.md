Ashartak is a smart glove that can instantaneously translate standard Arabic sign language into text. It is designed to bridge the communication gap between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who do not understand sign language.

The glove is equipped with sensors that capture the movements and gestures of the wearer's hand. These signals are processed using machine learning algorithms and converted into corresponding Arabic text.
